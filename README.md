This project is my CV created in React

This project is a test provided by a company.
The owner asked to turn my CV into a website page.

He only asked to build the project using HTML, CSS & Javascript JS.
He didn't have any other pre-requisites except the languages.
I was free to use whatever means to produce the final result.

I decided to create the project using React & CSS flexbox to show my skill progress.
It is a very basic web page with a few functionalities.

Here are my personal subgoals:

- Make the website fully responsive (from at least 360px wide to more)
- Create a nav bar that will appear only on large screens (769px and more)
- Create a burger menu that will appear only on small screens (768px & less)
- Create a modal nav bar that will appear only when the user scrolls down
- Showcase my projects in a basic carousel
- Structure the files in the react project
